- MAKE THE DAMN SLOT MACHINE MINIGAME :P
- Corrosion Ailment for 'Armor Poison' [based on DoomRPG]

- 'maybe' make a custom shrink projectile to get around the 'no shrinking things with < 24 x/y-repeat' issue.
- Make Tanks able to push crates within it's weight limit.
- Equippable that will allow natural AP regeneration if you have an Armor item, but it will not set AB% to a specfic amount. It would make it more like how characters have natural and slow HP regen
- Make an equippable item that splits damage taken by the wearer between all members of the group.
- Make a randomizer mode for monsters [monsters of a specfic 'species' can randomly upgrade into stronger [non-boss] counterparts, similar to DV-DS. Also can randomly flag non-boss enemies as elites.
