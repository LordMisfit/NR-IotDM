Compile Size in EDuke32 : 789,530(x4) bytes [5.22.git58]; was 765,937(x4) bytes [5.22]

Description             : The most recent version of an [otherwise] 15-16 year-old modding project started long back in 1997. NR has been through many hardships and dire straits, but with certain sources of inspiration, I decided to reattempt making this mod back in late 2006, after a 3-4 year dead period after the unfortunate demise of version 3.x[which along with 2.x and 1.x died in HDD crashes/deaths]. This mod is a major alagmation of my modding and coding skills with CON files so far, but is not meant as a mere "blackbox" mod or an "enhancement" mod. There is a storyline in the works for this, else the sheer amount of coding[789,500+ compiled bytes] and features would be considered ridiciously overboard even by my standards. o_o;

Synopsis                : "1 year after the initial alien invasion in Duke Nukem 3D and the death of the newborn Alien Queen in the Atomic Edition, the murderous aliens still persist despite Duke's efforts to destroy them, but after their recent invasion of Washington D.C. is ruined and the President of the United States is saved by Duke Nukem himself(the events of "Duke it out in D.C."), their true leader finally shows her real colors, in a cataclysmic show of hands that will rock the foundation of Duke Nukem's entire life and principles. Even the great alien ass-kicker himself soon finds he is outmatched on his own, and will against his pride need all the help he can get to defeat this Alien Super-Queen before not only Earth, but all life in the universe are left prey to her evil natures! 
                          So Duke, Are You Ready to Fend off the Invasion of Naferia, the Dark Mistress?"

Storyline               : TO BE ANNOUNCED IN THE FUTURE, BUT THERE WILL BE ONE, TRUST ME. THE SYNOPSIS WILL SERVE YOUR APPITITE FOR NOW. :P

Modification Taglines   : "No hero or villain, no matter how cool, powerful, talented, skilled or charasmatic can do everything all by themself. Even they eventually hit their limits, whether it be the limit of their patience or the limit of their skill, power and talent..."
                          "Teamwork might feel like a drawback, but it's also the only way for even HIM to survive THIS war..."
                          "He who is corrupt and She who is almighty have joined forces against you. It's only fair you have friends of your own..."
                          "She Awaits You... But do you think she's all that's waiting for you??"

                          Steamchip's "FEMCON" and "Operation Warehouse" for the basis of the civilian rescue code.
                          MBlackwell for giving me the basic skeleton for the character-switch system code.
                          Dr. Klystien for his EDukeWiki tutorial on making numeric keypads.
                          James from AMC for allow me use of his camera-direction-control code.
                          Fantinaikos for some recent developments and graphics, like the Riot-Tank interior used when driving the new Riot-Tank player vehicle, and modified BOSS1/BOSS2 Jump/Crouch sprites(used for ESSence and Cybanis right now). He is also trying to develop things for a future NR HRP. :o
                          Christina Richter @ "http://blaubeermars.deviantart.com" for the improved sprites for the Mercury VR Visor and Mercury Mini-Computer.
                          DeeperThought for... lots of stuff, where do I begin? Basically, the inventory displays were inspired by his own versions. Code for the mantling and the ladder/wall climbing is from the DukePlus modification of his. The double jumping ability is from his "Duke Nukem: Weapons of Mass Destruction" mod as well, and also the basis of the Money Radar is from his idea for the 'Soul Coin Radar' in DNWMD. Also, the biggest credit to him is the fact that said mod was what made me re-realize what EDuke was capable of after having not tried to work on this mod in nearly 5 years. The original 3 versions of NR[the first two of which sucked however] where lost to various Hard-Drive crashes. The third version had a lot of maps worked on, but little coding, which I sucked at back then. When I lost the third version originally, I got fed up and gave up on it, originally planning to make it a future fictional story project, but then last year I got inspired slowly by DNWMD and began adding some of my own features I found cool as well as stuff I would've used in the old NRs, and it suddenly made me wake up and want to do this mod again. Now the mod has gone further than it ever has, and I feel that if it were not for the creativity of DeeperThought's work that I'd have missed out on the chance to rebirth this mod. So thanks to you man. =) Also he made the prototype code for the HUB system NR uses as of 5.13. o.o
                          Ryan Cordell aka "Blade Nightflame" for being a playtester, even if he likes using only Duke in most of his games. XD
                          TheSeriousCacodemon, for being a good long-time friend and playtester for me, and for his "Talkthrough" videos of NR that shows off things for the mod in the original four episodes. Note that the modified levels are only for the talkthrough and are not for public domain since 3D Realms [regardless of their status, see below] does not like people publicly distributing modified maps of the original levels. The "Talkthrough" can be found at "http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A57950DD98558A26" and goes up to the end of Episode 4 and is finished.
                          Ian M. Burton, aka Zero X. Diamond, the provider of the http://www.zxdware.net/ domain which up until late August 2009 was the host for NR's main site, and also a good friend of mine for many years. Here's to hoping he finds more work and his life turns around in light of recent events. :\
                          Angel Eyes aka Somagu for a bunch of recent playtesting and finding of some bugs that might have snuck into some newer versions if he had not noticed them. :P
                          3D Realms themselves, the creators of Duke Nukem 3D. As of 5.14 this portion will be a tribute to them, since as of the week of May 9, 2009, they have been forced to shut down due to various finanical problems and thus the likelihood of "Duke Nukem Forever" being released has basically become nil. Rest in Peace, and lets hope you guys resurrect from the grave someday [the company I mean, not the employees, all of them are still alive and well as far as I can tell :P]
                          Kyle Belanger, aka Kyle873, for getting me off my ass for some more NR work after almost 15-16 months of inactivity and getting me to help revamp the UI with his own coding work and help. Probably also one of my more prominent bug-finders, even if it sometimes annoying me just how many he found in 5.20. ;P
                          
======================================================================

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #[s]  : Eventually, it will span over the equalvalent of several episodes[or chapters as they will be called in-game], although it will be played as one super-episode a la Doom 2 [no equipment resets between chapters, etc]. But for now it is mainly code, sounds and art for now, oh and !NR.MAP, which is a map with demonstrations of many of the mod's features and specialities. Also, WARP.MAP, WARP_SPE.WAP and WARP_ZOO.MAP are available to use to select skill levels higher than 4, or to go to specfic maps in an episode.
Single Player           : Yes, that's pretty much the entire point of this mod. :P
DukeMatch Level         : No, It will go Horribly out of Sync, and even if it wasn't, it's not designed for MP due to the sheer amount of balance issues presented by the multi-character system. If against all dire straits a DukeMatch variation can be done, I'll let you know, but I probably won't do it myself, someone else will have to add the code themselves. :P
Difficulty Settings     : TEN Difficulty Levels exist in this modification, not just FOUR. XD
Plutonium Pak/Atomic?   : Yes, it is necessary to have this
New Art?                : Yes, there's a lot, despite a lot of it not yet having an appearance in anything yet[future levels will be using this art, hence it's here as preparation]
New Music?              : Not Yet, as I've been using Winamp during game plays. I have ideas for some songs & tracks, but you can also suggest or make me music of your own if you really want to. :P
New Sounds?             : Yes, even has voice acting by various people for many of the playable characters. XD
New .CON Files          : Yes, for without them, this mod is worth absolutely freakin' nothing. :P GAME, USER, DEFS, ENHANCE, SPECIAL, STATES, PICKUPS, SCRIPTS, CHARACTERS, SHOPS are the con file names.
Demos Replaced          : No. EDuke32 and most demo files don't mix well, not to mention, sync issues make them broken anyways.

* Construction *

Bases/Inspirations      : Inspired by multiple RPGs [Earthbound series, Final Fantasy series, Lufia series, Chrono Trigger, etc] and classic FPS games [Doom, Hexen, Strife, Heretic, Wolfenstein 3D, Shadow Warrior the original Duke Nukem 3D (lol, of course :P), etc], and even some specialized series [Mega Man [X] series, Castlevania series (both classic and Metroidvania types of games), Fire Emblem series, Age of Empires series, etc]. But most importantly Media Vision's "Crime Crackers" Duology, as two of the first FPS games to combine RPG elements on a level unseen [including level-ups/improvable-stats and multiple characters in the same group]. Without this series' existance, NR would not be anything like it is now [if it ever existed at all without it, that is.]
Level Editor(s) used    : Mapster32
Art Editor(s) used      : DukeRes(almost always) & EDITART(rarely). I also use Paint Shop Pro 9/10 a lot as an outside editor.
Known Bugs              : Likely there will be plenty with the sheer number of features this mod has, but I always work to stomp the critters flat, so inform of me of bugs so I can do that! >:D
Construction Time       : v4+ has taken over 63 months so far, however the original old-school NR [v1 to v3] has been in my mind for over 10 years, so if you add that, about 12 years. Original v1 to v3 were lost in a HDD crash many years ago and I almost gave up on this mod. See credits above to see why I restarted this. o_o

* Notes & Etc *

Important Notes         : If you need, you can use code from the CONs if you can dicipher it, but I want you to contact me if you plan to use anything like the character-switching system so I at least know it's being used for something. Also, if you plan to use anything I have that belongs to another person, you need to let me and them know first and ask them. I don't mind if they don't mind, but if they do, I don't want you using their code without their permission.

                          ALSO: To activate the menus, press the "Inventory Left" key[usually "[" key]. This is important to do if this is your first time getting any 5.x version since the System Settings in the menu are now logged to your duke3d.cfg file and will likely default to 0[OFF]. You need to go into the menu to set the ones you want on.

===========================================================================

* HOW TO CREATE NR-SPECFIC EFFECTS IN YOUR OWN MAPS :P *

=I. Setting a Sector to alter the Skill/Difficulty=

1. Set the intended sector's lotag to 20001
2. Set the intended sector's hitag to 1000 PLUS the number representing the difficulty level [Skill 0 = hitag 1000, Skill 9 = hitag 1009, etc]
3. When you step into this sector, the Difficulty level will change with a quote on top of the screen telling you what your new difficulty level is called.


=II. Setting a Sector to warp to a certain episode and level=

1. Set the intended sector's lotag to either 20000
2. Set the sector's hitag to XYY. In other worlds if you want to go to Episode 1, Level 1, set the Hitag to 101. If you want to go to Episode 3, Level 17, set the hitag to 317. The Episode can be from 1 to 7 [1YY/2YY/3YY/4YY/5YY/6YY/7YY], and the Level can be 1 to 64 [X01 to X64].
3. When you enter the sector, you will immediately go to the set Episode and Level except with no intermission screen.
(Note) Setting the lotag to 19999 will perform the same effect, but also clears your full-game tallies at the pause screen and resets your total in-game timer.


=III. Setting a Sector to add/remove a specfic character to your team=

1. Set the intended sector's lotag to 20003
2. Set the intended sector's hitag to the character's ID number:
  0- = Nothing
  1 = Duke
  2 = Jack
  3 = Bubsy
  4 = Ami
  5 = Higa
  6 = ESSence
  7 = Ted
  8 = Lisa
  9 = Cybanis
  10 = Christina/Nethra
  11 = Paula
  12 = Lori
  13 = Minako
  14 = "Mysterious Lady"
  15 = Maken
  16+ = Nothing
3. When you enter the sector, you'll gain that character if you didn't have him or her, or you'll lose that character if they were already in your group. Staying in the sector for a second will toggle them back and forth from "in your team" to "out of your team" if left in place.


=IV. Making a Ladder/Wallclimber=
*NOTE: This is actually a method based from DeeperThought's DukePlus modification. It is basically the same method as his version. However a different sprite is used to represent the ladder/wallclimber. Most of this is taken from the Duke Plus manual with small changes.

1. To make a ladder/climable wall, you need to place two sprites of tile number 5448 (name WALLCLIMBER, aka the letter 'W' in the SE font). If these are tagged as ladders/climbable walls, they will become invisible once the game starts.

2. Set the EXTRA of each WALLCLIMBER to 1, and make sure the pair of sprites has the same hitag.

3. Place one of the sprites above the other. The higher sprite will be the top of the ladder/wall, the lower sprite the base of the ladder/wall. Make sure that the ladder/wall top is where you want the player to get off the ladder/wall. That means it must be almost a full player's height above the ledge, or else the player will simply fall back down when reaching the top of the ladder/wall. Of course, the graphics you use to represent the ladder/wall do not need to extend above the ledge, only the special sprite defining the ladder/wall top does.

4. The angle of the base of the ladder/wall will be the angle that the player is supposed to face when using the ladder/wall. So, if the ladder/wall is up against a solid-wall, then point the WALLCLIMBER sprites at the solid wall.

(Optional) 1. Give the WALLCLIMBER sprites a lotag to define a sound to make when the player climbs the wall. 535 and 536 are special sounds that will alternate randomly back and forth if set and are best used when the wall is meant to serve as a ladder.

(Note) 1. The x and y coordinates of the base of the ladder/wall will determine the ladder/wall's actual position (the sprite for the top of the ladder/wall is only referenced for its z coordinate, so technically it doesn't matter where you put it, as long as it is above the base). That means that ladders/walls are strictly up and down affairs and cannot be sloped.

(Note) 2. The speed of the character in-play will determine both how fast they move up/down a ladder/wall and how frequently the climbing sounds play. Being on steroids also affects climbing speed.


=V. Making numeric keypads=

1. Place a KEYPAD sprite[#3069] where you need it to be.
2. Give it a lotag in the same way you would a normal switch.
3. You can link the lotag to Forcefields, Activators, Respawn Sprites & ActivatorLocks like most switches.
4. Give the KEYPAD a hitag of 1 to 32767. The hitag is the "passkey" to successfully activate the KEYPAD's effects.

(Optional 1) 1. To add "security" damage to a KEYPAD[when you don't enter the correct code], set the "extra" of the keypad to 0, 1, 2 or 3. 0 will make the damage electric-elemental, 1 makes it freeze-elemental, 2 makes it fire-elemental, and 3 makes it poison-elemental(and will sometimes poison the recipient)].
(Optional 1) 2. Set the x-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] of the KEYPAD to any non-zero value. Positive numbers are exact damage [in HP], and negative numbers convert to a %-format[in HP, and out of 100.0%, so a xvel of -256 equals 25.6% HP damage).

(Optional 2) 1. To set a customized "error" sound for the KEYPAD, set the y-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] to the sound number you want to use [0 will default to the normal error sound however].
(Optional 2) 2. To set a customized "success" sound for the KEYPAD, set the z-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] to the sound number you want to use [0 will default to the normal success sound however].

(Caution) If you use this to deactivate a forcefield that has a normal switch connected to it, it will disable the normal switch's function while the forcefield is switched off. Switch it back on via the keypad to be able to use the normal switch on it again.


=VI. Making handprint-scanners=

1. Place a HANDSCANNER sprite[#4082], a HANDSCANNER2 sprite[#4084], a COMPACTHANDSCANNER sprite[#3607] or a COMPACTHANDSCANNER2 sprite[#3620] where you need it to be.
2. Give it a lotag in the same way you would a normal switch.
3. You can link the lotag to Forcefields, Activators, Respawn Sprites & ActivatorLocks like most switches.
4. Give the HANDSCANNER/HANDSCANNER2/COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2 sprite a hitag of 1 to 65535. The hitag is a bitfield which determines which characters will be able to use the scanner.
 1 = Duke
 2 = Jack
 4 = Bubsy
 8 = Ami
 16 = Higa
 32 = ESSence
 64 = Ted
 128 = Lisa
 256 = Cybanis
 512 = Christina/Nethra
 1024 = Paula
 2048 = Lori
 4096 = Minako
 8192 = "Mysterious Lady"
 16384 = Maken
 Ex: hitag of 8492 = Bubsy, Ami, ESSence, Cybanis and "Mysterious Lady" can use the Handscanner

(Optional 1) 1. To add "security" damage to a HANDSCANNER/HANDSCANNER2/COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2[when you don't use it with the correct character(s)], set the "extra" of the keypad to 0, 1, 2 or 3. 0 will make the damage electric-elemental, 1 makes it freeze-elemental, 2 makes it fire-elemental, and 3 makes it poison-elemental(and will sometimes poison the recipient)].
(Optional 1) 2. Set the x-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] of the HANDSCANNER/HANDSCANNER2/COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2 to any non-zero value. Positive numbers are exact damage [in HP], and negative numbers convert to a %-format[in HP, and out of 100.0%, so a xvel of -59 equals 5.9% HP damage).

(Optional 2) 1. To set a customized "error" sound for the HANDSCANNER/HANDSCANNER2/COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2, set the y-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] to the sound number you want to use [0 will default to the normal error sound however].
(Optional 2) 2. To set a customized "success" sound for the HANDSCANNER/HANDSCANNER2/COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2, set the z-velocity [F8 in 2D mode] to the sound number you want to use [0 will default to the normal success sound however].

(Optional 3) 1. HANDSCANNER, HANDSCANNER2, COMPACTHANDSCANNER and COMPACTHANDSCANNER2 sprites can be given specfic palettes to have different appearances, but it will not alter it's overall effect.

(Caution) If you use this to deactivate a forcefield that has a normal switch connected to it, it will disable the normal switch's function while the forcefield is switched off. Switch it back on via the handscanner to be able to use the normal switch on it again.


=VII. Making 'expanded' Keyscanners for keycards and using the 4 new keycard colors=

 * Keys *
1. Place an ACCESSCARD[#60] or ACCESSCARD2[#4086] sprite in the map. All ACCESSCARDS become ACCESSCARD2 upon load up though [due to the recoding of the actors].
2. Palettes Supported:
  0 = Blue Keycard [classic]
  21 = Red Keycard [classic]
  23 = Red Keycard [classic]
  12 = Silver Keycard [new]
  15 = Brown Keycard [new]
  24 = Bloody Keycard [new]
  22 = Green Keycard [new]

 * Keyscanners that use Silver, Brown, Bloody and Green Access Cards *
1. Place an ACCESSSWITCH3[#4087, Earth-style] or ACCESSSWITCH4[#4088 Space-style] where it's needed, instead of the normal ACCESSSWITCH or ACCESSSWITCH2 actors. The new ones can accept the newer key colors, the older ones can't.
2. Palettes Supported:
  0 = Blue Keyscanner [classic]
  21 = Red Keyscanner [classic]
  23 = Red Keyscanner [classic]
  12 = Silver Keyscanner [new]
  15 = Brown Keyscanner [new]
  24 = Bloody Keyscanner [new]
  22 = Green Keyscanner [new]
3. You can link the lotag to Forcefields, Activators, Respawn Sprites & ActivatorLocks like most switches.
4. Like with the classic versions, the hitag represents the sound played when the Keyscanner is used.


=VIII. Making Various "Instant Death" sectors and "Pitfalls"=

 * Classic Pitfalls * [falling too low kills you instantly, i.e. falling into a pit with no bottom]
1. Create your pit, and make sure it's really deep to create a realistic effect
2. Place a DEATHPITFALL[#18] sprite in the pit sector/s.
3. Give the sprite[s] an extra of 0 [press 'M in 3D-Mode/ALT-M in 2D-Mode to change Extra]
4. Place the sprite[s] at the height you want the player to fall to/past to trigger the "instant death" feature.

 * Inversed Pitfalls * [going too high kills you instantly, i.e. flying too high out of a breathable atmosphere]
1. Place a DEATHPITFALL[#18] sprite in the sector/s.
2. Give the sprite[s] an extra of 1 [press 'M in 3D-Mode/ALT-M in 2D-Mode to change Extra]
3. Place the sprite[s] at the height you want the player to RISE to/past to trigger the "instant death" feature.

 * Instant Death * [entering sector kills you regardless of vertical/z position, i.e. space-sectors without paralaxxed floors/ceilings]
1. Place a DEATHPITFALL[#18] sprite in the sector/s.
2. Give the sprite[s] an extra of 2 [press 'M in 3D-Mode/ALT-M in 2D-Mode to change Extra]


=IX. Creating "Emulated/Disquised Damagefloors/sectors"=

1. Set the hitag of the intended sector[s] to one of the following
 5385 = NEWFLOORSLIME [weakest] (Average Damage: {1+(rand[3])}/tic; 6.25% chance of damage/tic; 1.5625% chance of getting "Poison" per interval; {1} point of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 5388 = NEWHURTRAIL (Average Damage: {1+(rand[3])}/tic; 12.5% chance of damage/tic; {1} point of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 5389 = NEWFLOORPLASMA (Average Damage: {1+(rand[3])}/tic; 12.5% chance of damage/tic; {1} point of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 5395 = NEWPURPLELAVA (Average Damage: {1}/tic; 100% chance of damage/tic; 4.6875% chance of getting "Poison" per interval; {1} point of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 3796 = AMOEBAACID (Average Damage: {4+(4*rand[4])+(0.0%-1.3% HP)}/tic; 15.625% chance of damage/tic; {2+rand[1]} points of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 3780 = HOTLAVA (Average Damage: {9+(9*rand[4])+(0.1%-2.7% HP)}/tic; 25% chance of damage/tic; {5+rand[1]} points of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 4091 = MEGALAVA (Average Damage: {75+(75*rand[5])+([0.02%-0.05%]+[0.1%-3.3%] HP)}/tic; 37.5% chance of damage/tic; {7+rand[2]} points of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 5401 = ULTRALAVA (Average Damage: {240+(240*rand[5])+(0.5%-27.0% HP)}/tic; 50% chance of damage/tic; {12+rand[3]} points of damage to Boots per damage interval)
 5443 = HYPERMAGMA [strongest] (Average Damage: {800+(800*rand[6])+(2.0%-108.0% HP)}/tic; 87.5% chance of damage/tic; {26+rand[8]} points of damage to Boots per damage interval)
2. If you want the effect to only occur the normal way[standing on the ground], do NOT set the lotag of the sector to 2.
3. If you want the effect to occur anywhere vertically in the sector[like in a pool of a damaging subtance], make sure to set the lotag of the sector to 2[makes it an UNDERWATER sector with full-sector damage capabilities]

NOTE: Setting an Underwater Sector's ceiling tile to any of the above numbers for the emulated hitag will also make the entire sector able to damage you, just like being submerged in a hazardous liquid.

NOTE2: It is possible to COMBINE these methods together for up to two different damagetypes, or a double-effective varient of one damagefloor/sector type.


=X. Air-Bubbles and AirBubble Generators=

1. Place an AIRBUBBLEGENERATOR[#5375] sprite anywhere, although it will work best underwater.
2. There are multiple tags to give that can effect the interval rate of attempted bubble-spawns, the success rate of spawning a bubble at each interval, the amount of air[in tics] each spawned bubble gives to the player/actor who grabs it and other things:
   hitag = set from 1 to 256. This is the chance [out of 256] that a bubble will successfully spawn on each spawn interval. [defaults to 128[50%] if not set, and will set to 256[100%] if set above 256]
   lotag = set to the amount of time in tics between each attempt to spawn a bubble. 26 = 1 second. [defaults to 6 if not set]
   x-velocity [highlight sprite in 2D mode, press F8] = set to the base amount of air in each bubble[in airtime tics]. 26 is a second of restored airtime to whoever grabs the bubble spawned [defaults to 12 if not set]
   y-velocity [highlight sprite in 2D mode, press F8] = set to the first error value of air in each bubble [the value will be a random amount between the negative of this amount and the positive of this amount to give randomisity to each spawned bubble] [defaults to 3 if extra is -1]
   z-velocity [highlight sprite in 2D mode, press F8] = set to the second error value of air in each bubble [the value will be a random amount between the negative of this amount and the positive of this amount to give randomisity to each spawned bubble] [defaults to 3 if extra is -1]
   extra ['M in 3D mode/ALT-M in 2D Mode] = if left at -1, the y-vel and z-vel will default to 3 regardless of their original settings, otherwise the y-vel and z-vel will remain set to your customized values


=XI. "ELITE" Monsters=

1. Set the monster's z-velocity[zvel] [highlight sprite in 2D mode, press F8], and include 512 in the number[like a bitfield].
2. You can also set a RESPAWN sprite to spawn an Elite monster by setting it's z-velocity in the same way.
3. Here are features of "ELITE" monsters.
  a. HP/AP/Attack/Defense/FirstAid/Airtime are multiplied by 4 times.
  b. Any powerups they wake up with have 4 times as much duration.
  c. Their armor absorbsion rate[if any] will be doubled [up to the full 100%].
  d. All damage done to ELITE monster is automatically cut by a random 50 to 75 percent.  
  e. All damage dealt to you by an ELITE monster is increased by a random 25 to 50 percent.
  f. All deflected damage[via Invulnerability/Triad Refractor/Mirror Shield] cut by 50 to 75 percent.
  g. The shrinker has a substantally lesser success rate against all ELITE monsters.
  h. All damagesector/floor damage is cut by 87.5 to 93.25 percent.
  i. Their level-icon is represented by a Nuke-symbol instead of a star.
  j. They can fall 8 tics longer than non-elite enemies before they suffer fall-damage [aka +8 Fall-Resistance]
4. You can also set RESPAWNs that are set to spawn an enemy to spawn ELITE monsters. Give the RESPAWN sprite the same flags/zvel(512) you want the enemy-to-be-spawned to have.

NOTE: You can also spawn ELITE monsters via the console by including "2048" in the cstat value [again, like using a bitfield] [so a full solid ELITE monster would have a cstat of 2305].


=XII. Setting Specfic Vending Machine Limits=

1. Set any wall texture to tile #s 1212[VENDMACHINE], #1215[COLAMACHINE], #7665, #7666, #7667, #7668, #7669, #7670, #7672, #7673, #7674, #7675, #7676, #7677, #7678, or #7679.
2. Set the wall's hitag to any number. If left at 0, the vending quanity in the machine will default to 64 snacks/drinks.


=XIII. Setting "Flags/Properties" on Pickup-Items=

1. Set the zvelocity[zvel] of the object in BUILD/Mapster32 by pressing F8 in 2D mode. The zvel works like a bitfield, add and include values for a mix of effects,
  a. 1 = Invisible Completely to all player means. This means the player cannot see the item, but they can still pick it up. This flag nullifies properties 1024[below] and 2048[below] automatically as it overrides them.
  b. 2 = The pickup will be 'silent' for players. This means grabbing the item will not show a message, make a sound, flash the screen, or any other indicator it normally will without the flag set. Works only for players, but combining this with 4[below] will make it silent to both parties.
  c. 4 = The pickup will be 'silent' for monsters. This means grabbing the item will not show a message, make a sound, flash the screen, or any other indicator it normally will without the flag set. Works only for monsters, but combining this with 2[above] will make it silent to both parties.
  d. 8 = Prevents the player from being able to grab the item, allowing only monsters[if applicable] to grab the item]. If combined with 16[below], it will make the item completely ungrabbable to both parties.
  e. 16 = Prevents all monsters/NPCs from being able to grab or seek out the item, allowing only players to grab it. This is of no use on items that cannot be picked up by monsters normally, however if combined with 8[above], it will make the item completely ungrabbable to both parties.
  f. 32 = Inverses the falling/hovering properties of the item. If the item normally falls under gravity, it will float/hover instead, and it will make items that normally float and hover fall to the ground instead.
  g. 64 = Item will hover up and down in place, like items in Heretic/Hexen Style, but only if the item is set NOT to fall.
  h. 128 = Item gives DOUBLE[2x] the normal pickup benefit. If combined with 256[below], it will OCTOPULE the pickup benefit[or a 8x benefit].
  i. 256 = Item gives QUADRUPLE[4x] the normal pickup benefit. If combined with 128[above], it will OCTOPULE the pickup benefit[or a 8x benefit].
  j. 512 = Grabbing the item will trigger all RESPAWNs, ACTIVATORs, W_FORCEFIELDs, ACTVATORLOCKEDs, MASTERSWITCHes and other operators when picked up. Ex: Picking up a Keycard like this opens a door and spawns monsters without the trouble of adding a TOUCHPLATE to a sector AROUND the keycard. You must also set the yvel of the object to the lotag of the objects to operate. [Ex: A yvel of 10 will activate RESPAWNs/ACTIVATORs/MASTERSWITCHes/ACTIVATORLOCKEDs/etc with a lotag of 10 and so on]
  k. 1024 = The item is invisible, but can be seen clearly with Nightvision Goggles or Ami's Mercury VR Visor. If 1[above] is included with this, this property will be nullified and overridden by the 'complete invisibility' flag. If 2048[below] is included with this, but without 1[above], then this property will be nullified by the "View with VR Visor Only" flag.
  l. 2048 = This item is invisible and can only been seen by Ami's Mercury VR Visor. If 1[above] is included with this, this property will be nullified and overridden by the y'complete invisibility' flag. If 1024[above] is included with this, but without 1[above], then this property will nullify the "View with Goggles & VR Visor Only" flag.
  m. 4096 = This item is "Jury-Rigged", which means that when the player or a monster[depending on the flags] grabs the item it will explode in their face, damaging them and their surroundings. However they will still receive the item's benefits. Using Ami's VR Visor will make these items glow nightvision green to warn you. Combining this with 8192[below] will nullify both properties.
  n. 8192 = This item is "Booby-Trapped", which is almost the same as a "Jury-Rigged" item except that it won't give you benefits. Using Ami's VR Visor will make these items glow nightvision green to warn you. Combining this with 4096[above] will nullify both properties.
  o. 16384 = Special Flag 1. Will have a different effect depending on the item in question. Used on money actors to keep them from showing up on the money radar, and on Armor-pickups to turn them into "Used" armor-pickups.
  p. 32768 = (undefined at the current time)
2. You can also set Flags/Properties to RESPAWNs that are set to spawn an item. Give the RESPAWN sprite the same flags/zvel you want the item-to-be-spawned to have.


=XIV. Setting "Flags/Properties" on Monsters=

1. Set the zvelocity[zvel] of the object in BUILD/Mapster32 by pressing F8 in 2D mode. The zvel works like a bitfield, add and include values for a mix of effects.
  a. 1 = Ends the Game When Killed [like a Pal-0 BOSS# monster] [not yet coded]
  b. 2 = Ends the current episode, and shifts to the next episode without resetting stats [seamless transition, for BOSS# monsters]
  c. 4 = (undefined at the current time)
  d. 8 = (undefined at the current time)
  e. 16 = (undefined at the current time)
  f. 32 = (undefined at the current time)
  g. 64 = (undefined at the current time)
  h. 128 = (undefined at the current time)
  i. 256 = (undefined at the current time)
  j. 512 = Flags the monster an an "ELITE" monster. Read "ELITE Monsters" section above to learn more about their properties.
  k. 1024 = When the enemy awakens, they will have a BOSS lifemeter appear on the screen showing their HP ratio[but only HP]. This will disappear when the enemy dies or 3 other enemies with the flag awaken. "Boss" tagged monsters also give more EXP and RANK on death.
  l. 2048 = (undefined at the current time)
  m. 4096 = Special Flag #1. Works only on LIZTROOPs at the moment. Setting this will cause them to wake up as suicide bombers immediately instead of waiting for their health to decline.
  n. 8192 = Player/Ally NPC Ally [not yet coded]
  o. 16384 = NaMa-Alligence Monster [not yet coded]
  p. 32768 = ElMa-Alligence Monster [not yet coded]
2. You can also set Flags/Properties to RESPAWNs that are set to spawn an enemy. Give the RESPAWN sprite the same flags/zvel you want the enemy-to-be-spawned to have.


=XV. Making "Clock Digits" for Stuff in-Game=

This affect allows you to make in-game clocks that will show the time based on your OS's clock and date. Examples include clocks seen on the signs of most real-life banks.

1. Set the Extra of the CLOCKDIGIT[#3458] actor to the following to represent a specfic digit.
  a. 1 = First digit of the current month # [Xm-dd-yy]
  b. 2 = Second digit of the current month # [mX-dd-yy]
  c. 3 = First digit of the current day # [mm-Xd-yy]
  d. 4 = Second digit of the current day # [mm-dX-yy]
  c. 5 = Third digit of the current year ['01 format, not "2001" format] [mm-dd-Xy]
  d. 6 = Fourth digit of the current year # ['01 format, not "2001" format] [mm-dd-yX]
  e. 7 = First digit of the current hour # [Xh:mm:ss]
  f. 8 = Second digit of the current hour # [hX:mm:ss]
  g. 9 = First digit of the current minute # [hh:Xm:ss]
  h. 10 = Second digit of the current minute # [hh:mX:ss]
  g. 11 = First digit of the current second # [hh:mm:Xs]
  h. 12 = Second digit of the current second # [hh:mm:sX]
  i. 13 = "A"/"P" in "AM"/"PM" [only shows if z-vel includes 1 (below)]
  j. 14 = "M" in "AM"/"PM" [only shows if z-vel includes 1 (below)]
2. For various effects on a digit, including the following values in the z-velocity [like a bitfield]
  a. 1 = When set with an extra of 7 or 8 [hours], the time will show in 12-hour format, instead of 24-hour military time.
  b. 2 = When set, the clock digit will blink every 0.5 seconds, similar to clocks that have recovered from power-outages.
  c. 4 = (undefined at the current time)
  d. 8 = (undefined at the current time)
  e. 16 = (undefined at the current time)
  f. 32 = (undefined at the current time)
  g. 64 = (undefined at the current time)
  h. 128 = (undefined at the current time)
  i. 256 = (undefined at the current time)
  j. 512 = (undefined at the current time)
  k. 1024 = (undefined at the current time)
  l. 2048 = (undefined at the current time)
  m. 4096 = (undefined at the current time)
  n. 8192 = (undefined at the current time)
  o. 16384 = (undefined at the current time)
  p. 32768 = (undefined at the current time)


=XVI. Setting Up Health-Stations=

This is for setting up the Half-Life/Doom3-like Health Stations new as of 5.15 of NR.

1. Place a FIRSTAIDPANEL_ON[#6198] sprite where you want the station to be and size it to your requirements. The panel requires direct view [you must be hitscanning it] in order to use it, and you must be really close to it as well. You'll know when you can use the station when a display appears telling you the station's stats.
2. Set the xvelocity[xvel] of FIRSTAIDPANEL_ON to a positive number for a percent based heal [1 = 0.1%, 14 = 1.4%, 1000 = 100.0%], or a negative number for an exact HP value to heal [-87 = 87 HP, -433 = 433 HP]. This is the amount of HP each "charge" from the station will give you.
3. Set the yvelocity[yvel] to the number of MAXIMUM charges for the panel to have. Generally the game will fill the panel to full charges upon start up.
4. Set the zvelocity[zvel] to the number of tics you want for recharging each "charge" when they are consumed. If left at 0, the panel will never recharge and can eventually run out of energy for good. 26 tics = 1 second.
5. Set the Extra[extra] to the number of tics for delay between a use of each charge when the use key is held down at a panel. Defaults to 3 if not set.
6. Set the Owner[owner] to 1 to allow the Health Station to fill up the character's portable medikit in addition to their HP. [only if they have at least 1 HP of medikit energy left]


=XVII. Money Bags=

Money Bags [actor MONEYBAG (#5146)] are used for special situations ingame. Monsters who drop money from 5.16 and on will now usually drop it in moneybags in order to save on processing space ingame [which multiple surpluses of money sprites in the map at once can really consume FPS on lower to middle-end machines]. They can also be used in Mapster32 and given specialized values if you want to bunch up money together into a single item for a specfic reason or for helping to make a bank or vault area of a map look more convincing. This part is for Mapster32 use.

1. Place a MONEYBAG actor on the map.
2. Setting up the pickup value works uniquely:
   a. xvel = This value can be from 0 to 32767. This number will be multipled by 32768 and then added to the value of the yvel [below] to determine the final dollar amount the bag is worth. If you need to make a value like 200,000 dollars, you could not put it into xvel, yvel or zvel alone, and you need to do it this way.
   b. yvel = This value will be added to the value of (xvel*32768) above for the final number of dollars in the bag. This can be from 0 to 32767.
   c. zvel = This is how many cents are in the money bag.
   d. extra = If 1, the money bag will not be detectable on the money radar.

EXAMPLE: To put $200,000 in a moneybag, set xvel to "6", and yvel to "3392". You'll need some understanding of math and multipliers to use this properly. The formula is [Dollars = ((xvel*32768)+yvel)] & [Cents = zvel] for a quick reference.

NOTE: If an empty Money Bag is placed on a map, it will disappear immediately in-game since it won't give anything [this means using the console to spawn a MONEYBAG won't work since it's spawned with nothing in it]


=XVIII. Flagging Specfic Sectors as Secrets [Swinging Doors[SE23]/Elevators/Subway Sectors[ST6]/Underwater Sectors[SE2]/Knee-deep Water Sectors[ST1]/etc].

The original Duke3D version of BUILD has only one Sector-Tag to designate a "Secret Area". This unfortunately means you can't use it in an area intended to be underwater secret [E1L4 and E4L4 have a couple of examples of possible underwater secrets]. NR has a means of bypassing it however. It's actually a very simple method.

1. Just place a SECRET_EXTENSION(Sprite# 5629) in a sector you intend to be made a secret area when the level is loaded. You can use this in normal sectors that can be flagged secret with a ST32767 tag, but it's redundant and won't make the sector worth double or anything. This is intended for the above types of areas which already have an ST that isn't 32767.

NOTE: You only need one SECRET_EXTENSION sprite per sector. Having more than one per sector is pointless, as the game will only increment the secrets counter once per sector. I won't go into specfics of how I have my secrets system set up, as that's not really important. :P


=XVIII. Making a Level Start with a Specfic Character Startup=

For mappers who want to force a specfic group of characters and/or "in-use character" at the start of a map can do the following.

1. Place a CHARACTERSTARTUP(#7955) actor on the map. (a character portrait with a "?" in it)
2. You need to give the CHARACTERSTARTUP actor a zvel (press F8 in 2D mode on the sprite) of anything that's NOT 0 [the default]. This will tell the game the CHARACTERSTARTUP is meant to act as what it's intended to do here instead of just a decoration sprite. Do not have more than one CHARACTERSTARTUP sprite with a non-0 zvel on the map, or else complications can result.
3. To set the group of characters, set the lotag to any number from 1 to 32767, as a bitfield. Combine numbers from the below list to get the group of characters you want to start with.
 1 = Duke
 2 = Jack
 4 = Bubsy
 8 = Ami
 16 = Higa
 32 = ESSence
 64 = Ted
 128 = Lisa
 256 = Cybanis
 512 = Christina/Nethra
 1024 = Paula
 2048 = Lori
 4096 = Minako
 8192 = "Mysterious Lady"
 16384 = Maken
 Ex: lotag of 653 = The level will start with Duke, Bubsy, Ami, Lisa and Christina/Nethra as playable characters.
4. To force the game to have a specfic character from the above selected when the level starts, set the hitag to a number from 0 to 15. Do note, that the character reference must match that of someone in the team as defined above with the lotag of the CHARACTERSTARTUP sprite or a random character will be selected. Also, if the hitag is set to 0 or a value HIGHER than 15, the game will automatically select a random character intentionally.
 <1 = Random Character
 1 = Duke
 2 = Jack
 3 = Bubsy
 4 = Ami
 5 = Higa
 6 = ESSence
 7 = Ted
 8 = Lisa
 9 = Cybanis
 10 = Christina/Nethra
 11 = Paula
 12 = Lori
 13 = Minako
 14 = "Mysterious Lady"
 15 = Maken
 >15 = Random Character

=XIX. Using the 'FREEZING_EXTENSION' actor/Making individual Sectors use "Freezing Environments" system.=

For mappers who want to for example, isolate freezing locations on a map to just a specfic area [i.e. the freezer/refrigerator in E3L1's kitchen area], you do the following.

1. Place a FREEZING_EXTENSION(#5628) sprite in all sectors intended to be affected.
2. If you want the sector to be warmer instead of colder [a warmer area in maps entirely affected by freezing], set the HITAG to a non-zero value. If you want to make a sector colder, leave the HITAG at 0.
3. Set the LOTAG of the sprite to whatever you intend the addictive freezing/warming to be. However do note that using this in maps which are entirely affected by the freezing system will ADD the value of the extension to the freezing intensity in those sectors, but only those sectors.

=XX. Making "Healing" Sectors.

For mappers who want to make sectors that act as a healing spring or beam of regenerative energy as opposed to a damaging sector like lava or toxic acid.

1. Place a HEALING_SECTOR(#5627) sprite in all sectors intended to be affected.
2. Set the xvelocity[xvel] of the HEALING_SECTOR sprite to one or a combination of the following values [like a bitfield]
  a. 1 = Health/HP is recovered
  b. 2 = Armor/AP is recovered
  c. 3 = HP & AP are recovered
  d. 4 = Energy/EP is recovered
  e. 5 = HP & EP are recovered
  f. 6 = AP & EP are recovered
  g. 7 = HP/AP/EP are recovered.
3. Set the yvelocity[yvel] of the HEALING_SECTOR to the % of HP/AP/EP/etc to recover in a single 'interval' [1 = 0.1%, 1000 = 100.0%, 2000 = 200.0%] (this applies to all point types defined by the sprite and cannot be set individually for each type)
4. Set the zvelocity[yvel] of the HEALING_SECTOR to the delay in 'tics' for each 'interval' of healing/recovery [26 tics = 1 second]
5. Set the extra of the HEALING_SECTOR to the % of HP/AP/EP/etc to recover up to [1 = 0.1%, 1000 = 100.0%, 2000 = 200.0%] (this applies to all point types defined by the sprite and cannot be set individually for each type)

=XXI. Slippery Sectors [Icy, Oily, etc]=

1. Set the sector's lotag to one of the following:
  a. 50 = Icy [Ami and Christina/Nethra will slide less on this than other characters]
  b. 51 = Oily [Barefoot characters (Bubsy, ESSence, Nethra) will slide less on this than other characters. Also has a random chance of the character "falling" down and being stunned while getting back up if they move over it too fast or if they land on it randomly from the air.]

===========================================================================

* FUTURE PLANS *

^ Add "ropes". [multi-direction ladders]
^ More graphics for characters. [BLAH]
^ More voices for characters. [It's... getting there. 2/15ths of the way or more :P]
^ Actual Storyline Levels. [YAY]
^ New Monsters and Bosses in General [@_@]
^ Fire Emblem-style support-system for playable characters [More than half finished, mostly need to make the conversations/a way to access them. %_%]
^ Greatly improve the way enemies/non-players 'swim' in the game. [@_@]

===========================================================================

* CHANGELOG *

=SINCE 5.22=
+ Character Trait/Skill: "Watch Over Me" for Paula. Increases Attack/Defense by increasing amounts depending on how many characters are dead.
+ Oversight Fix: Happy/Style/Charm Shoes no longer increment their timer[s] while you're in shops or at ATM prompts
+ Balance: Mindblasts ignore 33% of the target's defense now.
+ Balance: Spit Loogies ignore 60% of the target's defense now.
+ Balance: Lasers, Freezeblasts, and Expander rays ignore 40% of the target's defense stat now.
+ Balance: Rockets and explosives in general now ignore 50% of the target's defense stat. Devastator Rockets also inherit this bonus, AND they now ignore an additional 75% of the Defense stat on their own instead of 75%. This means missiles and rockets in general should now deal more damage between players and enemies and help speed up combat.
+ Memorbilia: 28 new posters.
+ Displays: If characters are on the opposing page from the current page, a prompt will show that you have characters there. This also works for using items/skills on characters as well.
+ Balance: Enemy chances of waking up with powerup items, protective boots and scuba gear are halved across all difficulty levels. Hopefully this significantly cuts down on the bitching and moaning people have given me about too many invuln-monsters showing up on the highest skills. Unless I still get a buttload of complaints from multiple players, this is as low as it's going though. >.>
+ Cheats: No-EP-Use/Infinte-EP cheat now affects Lisa fixing ATMs and vending machines, making it only cost the $ value when in effect.
+ Displays: Getting next to a vending machine will show the number of snacks/drinks left in the machine now.
+ Feature: Natural Regeneration for HP and EP are now affected by moving/resting/etc. Moving around horizontally slows down regeneration speed some, jumping straight up or falling down slows it down more, crouching still nearly doubles regeneration speed. Resting in a Riot Tank also increases regeneration speed, but by a lesser amount than crouching. Haste/Slow now affect regeneration speed for HP and EP as well. Going into defense mode also speeds up regeneration speed slightly.
+ Equipment: ????? ?? ???? ????? now increases falling-resistance for it's wearer by 2.5x.

=SINCE 5.21=

+ Weapon Bugfix: A critically annoying bug concerning the Shotgun randomly 'jamming' after switching characters was FINALLY fixed after having been around since the inception of the multi-character system. Hint to all future developers of mods like this, make sure the player struct called "random_club_frame" is reset to 0 upon switching characters. The problem was linked to having the shrinker/expander [or any weapon with a 'glowing' component] selected on one character and then switching straight to another character currently equipped with a Shotgun.
+ Jump Mechanics: Jumping is redone. No more sudden decceleration and reacceleration in midjump when jumping really high. Crouching and then jumping causes you to jump very low [the old system meant if you released crouch while in the middle of the jump you suddenly went from hugging the floor to launching into the air XD]. Also, air-jumps are now only 2/3s as powerful as a normal ground-launched jump. Crouching while falling will also SLIGHTLY increase a character's falling resistance to help reduce potential impact damage.
+ Display Bugfix: Fixed it where having undamaged SuperArmor would cause the description for damaged/used Super Armor to display in the inventory screen if you highlight it's blank spot holder.
+ Bug Fixes: Fixed a bug where invulnerable monsters can kill or affect a player by getting within range of one of their deployed Holoforms.
+ Feature Change: ATMs are changed. Cancelling from Deposits, Withdrawls and Wire Transfers go back to the options screen after an account login instead of completely logging the character out.
+ Feature Change: If you hold extra Duke3D-inventory items in your main inventory, you can press that item's respective button to give the current character one of that item if he/she is not currently carrying one directly already. [Applies to Portable Medikits, Holoforms, pairs of Night Vision Goggles, Jetpacks and Vitamin Xs]
+ Feature Change: Picking up a Duke3D-inventory item when the character has a partially depleted item of that kind in use, will instead put the item into the main inventory instead of refilling the partially-depleted item. [Applies to Portable Medikits, Holoforms, pairs of Night Vision Goggles, Scuba Tanks, pairs of Protective Boots, Jetpacks and Vitamin Xs]
+ Weapon Change: Pressing "4" will now cycle two firing modes for the chaingun, for those bitching at me they want the old chaingun back, you can now switch between bullets and rockets. :P
+ Displays: The weapons bar will show "4B"/"4R" and "5G"/"5S" to designate which mode of weapons 4 and 5 are current in use.
+ Worldtiles: A new set of 64 worldtiles have been added to the game's code, making up a total of 256 [from 192].


=SINCE 5.20=

+ Bug Fixes: Damage amounts no longer risk overflowing when using combinations of very powerful items or the 1000x damage cheat.
+ Items: Charm Shoes, Happy Shoes and Style Shoes have been nerfed to be not so broken over long playthroughs.
+ Displays/UI: A ton of changes have been made for the UI with more dynamic displays for certain stats which will only show when necessary now. FA and AB are now linked together with HP and AP instead of being seperate and no longer use their own bars. Buff icons and Powerup icons are more streamlined, inventory icons on the right side of the screen are scaled down. The Damage Displays and EXP/RANK displays are also scaled down somewhat. WARM/COZY and BOSS meters are also streamlined more properly. In general, most of the stuff on the lower half of the screen is less obstructive at first than it used to be.
+ Displays: Dialouge and One-liner quotes are in proper cases now to accomadate for the new lowercase font support.
+ Displays: Lowercase game font added to game.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Bloodpact Shield" added.
+ Displays: Getting within usable range of Vending Machines, Health-Stations and ATM machines will print a message on the screen indicating you are able to use them and which button to press to access them.


=SINCE 5.19=

+ Jumping: Characters will jump proper heights out of knee-high water [sectors with a lotag of 1] instead of the original hardcoded value, set to about 2/3's of their normal jumping strength.
+ New Features: "Healing Sectors" can be made with the HEALING_SECTOR(#5628) sprite. Instruction for the effect are listed above.
+ Displays: Most stats now have colored meters behind them, including EXP, Rank, HP, AP, AB%, FA, EP, EnergyShield. This also applies to Vehicle HP/AP/FA and AB% as well.
+ Displays: Energy Points now display on the character stat displays in the main game.
+ Displays: Lisa's Bio Energy shield has a display amount when available showing the total points of damage it can suffer versus the current amount it has left.
+ Energy Points: EP will now slowly regenerate for all characters.
+ Characters: Lisa now has the ability to fix/repair broken Cola/Snack Machines and ATM Machines for a cost of some EP and money depending on the machine in question.
+ Characters: Ami's VR Visor now has a slow drain on her EP, and cannot be used when at 0 EP.
+ Shop System: Multi-Buy/Multi-Sell is now available. You use the "Previous_Weapon/Next_Weapon" keys to cycle the amount one at a time, or use the number keys [1 to 0] to set the amount to increments of (10*keynumber) [0 will set it to 100, the maximum you can buy/sell of an item at once]
+ Rank System: If a character dies, you will receive a rank deduction of at least 1275 to 11250 points [depending on the difficulty level AND the level of the character who died], or even more based on a % of your Rank if it's higher than that. This is to encourage trying to keep all your characters alive more often to keep your rank up for shop bonuses and EDF-payments.
+ Rank System/Shops: RANK also now has a small effect on the price of all items for buying and selling in shops. It will be shown at the top of the shop's menu what your Ranking Letter is, and your benefit/penalty in the shop.
+ Rank System: RANK now has a few uses beyond actual score now. Your rank will determine how much any active character in your group is paid every 15.75 minutes by the EDF. All payouts go into the characters' ATM accounts [not your on-hand cash], and the payment is PER character.
+ Displays: EXP and RANK moved up above HP further, EP stat shows now on the main screen, colored meters show for EXP, RANK, HP, AP, EP, AMMO, PARTY ALIVE, etc.
+ Environmental Items: Many environmental "containers" [trash cans, barrels, vases, etc] can sometimes drop a random item or two when destroyed now. For CANWITHSOMETHING and friends, the original item set to drop will still spawn along with any random items it might spawn. Affected actors: FIREVASE, FIREVASE_OUT, FIREBARREL, FIREBARREL_OUT, CANWITHSOMETHING, CANWITHSOMETHING2, CANWITHSOMETHING3, CANWITHSOMETHING4, CANWITHSOMETHING5, CANWITHSOMETHING1NEW, CANWITHSOMETHING2NEW, CANWITHSOMETHING3NEW, CANWITHSOMETHING4NEW, TRASHCAN1, TRASHCAN2, TRASHCAN3, TRASHBAG1, TRASHBAG2, TRASHBAG3, TRASHBAG4, NUKEBARREL, MAILBAG, RUBBERCAN, FLOORBASKET, BOTTLE7, MONK, SPACEMARINE, LUKE, INDY, JURYGUY, SNAKEP, PIRATE1A, PIRATE2A, PIRATE3A, PIRATE4A, PIRATE5A, PIRATE6A, PIRATEHALF, ROBOTPIRATE, ROBOTMOUSE, JOLLYMEAL, BOTTLE11.
+ New Item: "Mystery Box". Can be shot to reveal random items [kinda like the ? Barrel in Megaman 3, except with the potential for many items at once].
+ NPCs: Many NPCs [civilians, animals, DEALER, babes, etc] have had their HP/AP revised to be much higher than it used to be so they don't seem like total pushovers to kill, but at the same time, it's randomized to some degree, like monsters' stats are.
+ Bugfix: "Used" Armor items now give only partial amounts of AP to non-selected characters like they should [via inventory use], instead of 100% AP. :P
+ Bugfix: Energy Drinks are fixed to prevent use on dead characters in the inventory menu.
+ CON-File Structure: SCRIPT.CON's contents were merged into the end of GAME.CON to cut down on the number of needed CON files.
+ CON-File Structure: USER.CON, DEFS.CON and ENHANCE.CON have been merged into "USERDEFS.CON" to cut down on the number of needed CON files.


=SINCE 5.18=

+ Characters: Bubsy's "Loki Mask" form, and both Ami and Minako's "Balanced Forms" now drain EP when in use to balance out the bonuses given by those forms.
+ Equippables: "Yin-Yang Orb" added.
+ Equippables: "Energy Incurment" added.
+ Equippables: "Serpent Helmet" added.
+ Equippables: "Medic Bag" added.
+ Equippables: "Snake Armband" added.
+ Equippables: "Twilight Cape" added.
+ Equippables: "Iron Rune" added.
+ Equippables: "Gemstone Crown" added.
+ Equippables: "Hockey Mask" added.
+ Gems: New "Gem" system. Occasionally, enemies will dropped Gemmed-Rings of silver or gold types. These items are sellable at various shops for money. Gold Ring sell for more than their Silver counter parts. There are eight types of gems: Zircon, Aquamarine, Turquoise, Emerald, Garnet, Ruby, Citrine and Diamond. EX: Gold Diamond Rings sell for $350,000 each, while Silver Zircon Rings sell for $200 each.
+ Bugfix: The Revised Speed system did not original take holding down the "Running" button while in Walk mode into account, and caused the player to tilt angles when moving at angles in general. It is accounted for now and works properly again. "Angel Eyes/Somagu" is to thank for pointing this out as well. :P
+ Bugfix: Buying Speed Bonuses in Shops did not give you the same increases as grabbing one as an actual item. In fact, for some of the naturally speedier characters, buying speed bonuses from Shops actually slightly DECREASED their speed due to this. Thanks to "Angel Eyes/Somagu" for pointing this out to me. XD
+ Item/Inventory System: All the inventory-storable items in the game have been moved into a simplified array set that will cut down on used vars and allow me to add more items in the future without worry of running out of room. >.>
+ Enemies: Enemies now have mortal-hit survivability rates like characters/players. When a monster survives an otherwise killing blow, they will flicker with invulnerablity [like in various games] for 1.5 seconds before you can try to damage/kill them again.
+ Damage Displays: A indicator of Critical hits now appears above an actor or player's damage displays when such is dealt, and will also give details to what type of critical was inflicted [Normal, Super, Mega or Giga].
+ Players: Players/Characters can now deal themselves critical hits via explosive weapons or anything with a hit-radius.
+ Enemies: Enemies can now inflict critical hits on players/characters and each other with their attacks.
+ ???????????: ?????? ?? ????
+ Sectors: 'Slippery' Sectors from DukePlus now available. Also, I got it that you won't slide when standing on objects that are standing in a slippery sector.
+ Balance: Resurrection Chalice no longer restores 100% HP to a revived character [except on Skill 0]. The amount is now dependant on Skill level [100%/(Skill+1)].
+ Graphics: Rank Star icons are updated for monsters, etc now.
+ Other: Sorted out Debugging Vars.
+ Shops: Item Descriptions from the In-Game Menus are displayed in shops instead of extra clutter in the item's name.
+ Freezing Environments: "FREEZING_EXTENSION" actor added. See above section for how-to-use.
+ Freezing Environments: FIRE, FIRE2, BURNING, BURNING2, FIREVASE, FIREBARREL, STEAM, CEILINGSTEAM, FLOORFLAME all increase players and actors' WARM meters when within range, like a real source of heat would. Also, getting hit by various explosions, expander waves, lasers, and etc also increase the target's WARM meter somewhat.
+ Freezing Environments: Actors [monsters, NPCs] are now under the affect of "Freezing Environments" like players.
+ Moderate Bugfix: Fixed a somewhat long and persistant [but rarely seen] bug with BOSS1, BOSS2 and BOSS3 where they would never die from fatal hits of drowning, falling and various other types of non-player/non-actor-related damage [which if not fixed would've also included freezing damage as well].
+ First Aid Panels: Minako's +50% health-benefit bonus effect now works with First Aid Panels.
+ Pickups: "Winter Clothes" added to give extra protection from freezing environments [below]. Winter Clothes additionally slow down the character about 15-20%, reduce jumping strength slightly, and give great resistance to ice-elemental attacks from any attacking player or monster. Winter Clothes deteriorate when the wearer is hit by attacks of enough damage. The less of the clothing left, the faster the character gets, but the more vulnerable they become to freezing environments and ice elemental attacks again.
+ Displays: WARM and COZY meters pop up to represent freezing meters in freezing environments [WARM meter] and intact-ness of Winter Clothing [COZY].
+ Weather System: 'Freezing Environment' feature added. This is unique to NR specfically and is supposed to simulate really cold areas in the game where you can potentially freeze to death due to extremes. It works in that the 'intensity' of the freezing affects how often you'll take freezing damage [and eventually die if you don't watch your health], and that being in or underwater when in a freezing area is even more damaging. Also, a system for Winter Clothes is in the works which will come to make a set of items each character can find to temporarily shield them from most of the freezing conditions.
+ Weather System: New sound for very heavy rain levels.
+ Weather System: Snow and Rain will fizzle and make sounds when landing on heated surfaces like lava.
+ New Feature: Imported over DukePlus's weather system as I had been hinting at for some time. This means rain and snow effects right now. Any additions or improvments I make will be mentioned in seperate notes above this one. :P
+ Bugfix: Characters not in use now have their Current AP checked all the time to make sure they can't have >0% AB when they have 0 AP, or <10% AB when above 0 AP.
+ Major Bugfix: Recoded a bunch of stuff related to the attached objects for actors [lifebars, rank-star, etc] which before had been causing a major bug for months which messed up sprite and sector listings in the engine, causing sprites to freeze in mid-air randomly and in general also probably contributed to a ton of NR's past stability problems and crashes. This is fixed and I have played an entire run through the original four episodes just a bit ago with no problems occuring, and two other beta testers have also reported no more problems in this area.
+ Bugfix: Character with 'buff' skills can no longer give buffs to dead characters. :P
+ Character Voices: Ted now has a voice actor and his 18 standard one-liners are now in the game. Thanks to "The Mighty Bison" for applying to be Ted's voice. :P


=SINCE 5.17=

+ ATMs: Using a broken ATM nows deals electrical damage at 3x-7x the amount as using a plug does.
+ Actors: CHARACTERSTARTUP(#7955) added. Allows you to set up a specfic and fixed group of characters to begin with at the start of a map.
+ Display Change: When unused characters in your group level up, you'll see what level they've hit instead of the increases to their stats now.
+ Displays: You can now see both your current level-time and your current game-time in the GAME PAUSED screen.
+ Characters: Ami now gains 50% extra HP from using Cola Machines, Water Geysers and Water Fountains, and she can also now increase her HP to 200% through these methods [an extension on part of her water-affinity powers].
+ Bugfix: WATERFOUNTAIN actor is 'fixed' to allow healing for the player again. This issue went unfixed for nearly 2 years since 4.8x when the HP/AP system was revamped from hard-coded struct-members to vars for higher limits for actors and players.
+ Characters: Characters now have a "Death Counter" for keeping track of how many times each one has died during a playthrough. They can be seen in a character's Status submenu.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Transdimensional Safe" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Stock Ownership" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Slurpee Machine" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Secret Recipe" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Safe Lock Box" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Malakian Gem" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Pair of Fixed Dice" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Rare Pirate Doubloon" added.
+ New Permenant Boost Item: "Silk Carnation" added.
+ New Items: Nine new items added, along with a brand new item category known as "Permenant Boosts". Permenant Boost items are non-equippable items that cannot be consumed, but sit in your inventory. However they grant minor, acculumative effects on your entire party or the game depending on how many of each you have. However they are limited to a degree that the effect of one of each Permenant Boost item only occurs for each member of your current party, so only up to 15 of each item can ever be fully used.
+ Items and Shops: Color-Class Armor [unused] items can be bought/sold from/to the shops now.
+ Displays: Using an Armor-type item from the inventory now shows the Armor Absorbsion % of the characters while going to select them.
+ Displays: Using a Super Atom from the inventory now shows the Armor Absorbsion % of the characters while going to select them.
+ Displays: More displays of buff timers and such will show up when using various skills in the menus now.
+ ATMs: ATM accounts can now accquire interest and grow over time. You'll see an interest rate at the welcome screen for each character/NPC's ATM account and how often it increments.
+ ATMs: A maelstrom of new ATM accounts has been added to ATM access. Some are for NPCs in future versions of the storyline, and others are various cameo accounts based on staff members or other well known people. About 20 to 30 new accounts have been added in this change, however you'll need to look through the CONs for most of them.
+ ATMs: The "Wire Funds" function has been revamped. You can no longer send money to an invalid account [thus wasting it], the name of the person you're wiring to will appear below the account number when entered, and both the wired amount of money and the receivers name will show up in the "Wire Successful" screen after completion of a wired-fund.
+ Enemy AI: Monsters can now go to nearby First-Aid Stations to heal themselves if injured badly.
+ New System: "Show Damage/Healing" is now available. A concept I wanted to add long ago but didn't know how to at the time with my [then] limited coding knowledge, thus leading to the other displays system you're all used to. After playing WGRealms2 recently, I looked through the code to figure out how they pulled it off. Admittingly, I first swiped their code almost completely to see if I could make it work in NR, but then I came up with my own ways to display it and "improve" it and removed a lot of their code and made my own in its place. This also shows AP damage in addition to HP damage.
+ Enemy AI: Monsters no longer automatically use their Portable Medikit the moment they detect their HP below 100%. Depending on the difficulty level, there is a random chance of them using the Portable Medikit every tic which increases with difficulty level.
+ Status Buffs/Ailments: The displays for the HUD and Status Submenus now displays the number of seconds [or hits for PK Shield] left for the buff or ailment below it. The text is on the small side though, but it's the size needed to fit properly.
+ Bugfix: Fixed an oversight where fortune cookies where giving enemies who grabbed them 50x the amount of HP they should have given. O.o
+ Mapping Tools: "SECRET_EXTENSION" actor added. Putting one in a sector will make the game tag it as a secret area upon level-start. This might sound redundant, but it's main purpose is to be used in conjunction with sectors which already are using a Tag that's NOT 32767 [which is the default secret-area tag]. This means you can tag underwater areas, areas knee-deep in water, elevator cars, two-way trains, subway cars, etc, as secret areas now. :D
+ Miscellaneous: Misc. Cheats added.
+ Character Voices: Duke has sounds for jumping and air-jumping [from Manhattan Project, care of Ryan Cordell's sound-ripping skills :P].


=SINCE 5.16=

+ Displays: New displays will appear when using some items on characters from the items menu. Examples include seeing the Characters' Jetpack amounts when going to give someone a jetpack, or seeing their FirstAid amount when using a Portable Medikit on them, etc.
+ New Items: Maximum EP Bonus added.
+ Energy System: The Energy-System is now available to NR. "Energy" or "EP" is basically like "MP" or "TP" in other RPGs, and gives a limit to how many times you can use your skills/special-attacks before needing to replenish it. All character skills now work on this system, characters have their own EP levels, and there are also now items for restoring EP, the "Small Energy Drink", "Large Energy Drink" and "Hyper Energy Drink".
+ Equippables: "Power Wrist" added to game. WHen equipped, your character's lifting strength and mantling strength will increase by 25%, their melee damage increases by 25%, and their non-melee damage increases by 10% for each pair worn. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Charm Shoes" added to game. When equipped, your character will gain a small amount of Cents[money] for every full second of controlled movement [moving foward/backwards, strafing left/right, swimming up/down, and jetpacking up/down count as "controlled movement" in this respect, but normal jumping does not]. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Style Shoes" added to game. When equipped, your character will gain a small amount of RANK for every full second of controlled movement [moving foward/backwards, strafing left/right, swimming up/down, and jetpacking up/down count as "controlled movement" in this respect, but normal jumping does not]. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Happy Shoes" added to game. When equipped, your character will gain a small amount of EXP for every full second of controlled movement [moving foward/backwards, strafing left/right, swimming up/down, and jetpacking up/down count as "controlled movement" in this respect, but normal jumping does not]. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "ShockAb Boots" added to game. When equipped, your character will take between 15% to 20% less fall-damage for each pair worn. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Jump Boots" added to game. When equipped, your character will jump 25% higher for each pair worn. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Rabbit's Foot" added to game. When equipped, your character has a +12.5% chance of surviving a deathblow with 1 HP left [aka mortal-hit survivability]. This item can be stackable up to 4 times.
+ Equippables: "Nyx Gloves" added to game. When equipped, your character will take no damage from "usuable" hazards, including electrical sockets, keyscanner security damage, keypad security damage, etc. Only one of these is required to be equipped on each character for this effect, even though multiple pairs can be equipped by one character [it's just redundant to do so. :P]
+ Equippables: "Riot Shield" added to game. Riot Shields are equippable items that give 20% resistance to Metal-based attacks [basically Shotgun pellets and other bullets] and additonally decrease Armor deterioration by 10% [your AP takes 10% less damage from all attacks after most things are factored, allowing armor to last a little longer]. This item can be stackable up to four times.
+ Skills/Buffs: "PK Shield" Buff is more complete and not half-assed anymore. Paula can also now actually use it on other characters/herself in the form of the "Psychokenetic Shield" skill in her skills submenu. A quadra of crystals also appears briefly on the player's display when the PK Shield takes a Mystical-based hit, like in Mother 3. It also has a 20% chance of deflecting a mystical-protectile away towards enemies.
+ Skills/Buffs: Cybanis has a new skill in his skills submenu: "Bloodlusting". It increases Critical Hit Rate% by 1/4 the base amount, plus an additional 20.25% to 95% depending on both the levels of Cybanis and the character affected by the buff [although Cybanis will use his own level both times if he's affected by the buff].
+ Bugfix: Characters now have their Drown-Damage-Ratios saved over between switching, preventing the player from cheating out of high damage intervals on a character from switching from and back to a drowning character.
+ Meter Displays: Air and Mantle Meters now also show the number of seconds the character have remaining over top of the meter.
+ ATMs: All ATM Money-Transfers are extended from a maximum of $50,000 to $5,000,000 each.


=SINCE 5.15=

+ Situational Changes: Characters will sometimes make comments when leveling up.
+ Situational Changes: Characters will make comments when they either narrowly steal an item away before an enemy grabs it, or the other way around.
+ Situational Changes: Characters will make comments when they save NPCs and get either their rewards, a mortar trap, or a spawned-in enemy.
+ Sounds: Bubbly sounds for air bubbles, drowning bubble sounds for characters and monsters alike added.
+ Character Voices: Lisa and Maken have all non-story/non-script lines completed. At last. >.>   Only 13 more characters remain to do this for. :P
+ Money Display: Money Displays recalculate better. Additionally, when using shops/ATMs, the display-timer for money will be frozen until leaving the shop/ATM in order for the player to see the full total of what they spent/gained from the shop/ATM in question.
+ Player: Grabbing an item with multipliers will consumed the required items and stored the rest in the inventory.
+ Enemies: Enemies who grab items with "multipliers" will drop behind any remaining items they could not use.
+ Enemies: Enemies can now grab Antidotes, Foghorns and Eyedrops when Poisoned, Confused or Dimmed, but not while unaffected by these.
+ Enemies: Enemies can now be hasted, slowed, poisoned, dimmed, confused and shelled in a similar way to players.
+ Items: New item: MONEYBAG. Money Bags are specialized money-type items meant to help cut down on overabundance of money sprites on a map due to monster drops, or just for putting a unique amount of money into one item, or for bank/vault type locations. How to use Moneybags in Mapster32 is included above.


=SINCE 5.14=

+ Worldtiles: 32 new worldtiles are added, making a total of 160 instead of 128.
+ Environment: Fans [sprites], ATMs [walls], Milk Coolers [walls], and Vending Machines [walls] now make humming sounds when close to them by default. Shooting out these things will also remove the sounds as well. Roulette Wheels also make a proper noise.
+ Items: Vitamin X can now make you jump higher and also improves your lifting weight, as well as giving you some boosts to falling resistance.
+ Player Displays: Characters now appear to breath when standing still. Their breathing becomes more noticable and labored depending on how much damage they've taken.
+ Player Displays: A Damage ring now appears when suffering damage, similar to newer FPS games.
+ Physics System: Implemented DukePlus's ability to grab and move weighted objects, specfically crates, but also added the ability to pull these items backwards or lift them above your head for extra throwing damage.
+ Enemies: Enemies now have variable speed depending on their level.
+ Enemies: COMMANDER type enemies have different sound pitches depending on their species.
+ Enemies: Octanine now has it's own set of sounds independant of the Octabrain.
+ Voices: Minako now has all 18 of her one-liners prepared for the game, and lines for powerup-grabbing. Thanks to Trollitrade @ http://www.youtube.com/trollitrade!
+ Visuals: Appearance of the Vampire Mask is improved with proper versions of the sprites now. o.o
+ Name Change: Vampire Artifact is now called "Vampire Mask"
+ Visuals: Quad Damage, Icon of the Defenser and Shield Emblem now have a higher level of detail[in game, not in mapster32, they still use the same sprite there], and have a spinning animation to improve their visual quality.
+ Visuals and Displays: Icons for Artifacts/Powerups are also now bordered icons with a different look instead of just a copy of the powerup's actual sprite.
+ Visuals and Displays: Status Icons [ailments/buffs] are no longer simple "Earthbound"-style 1-2 color squiggly lines, and are actual square icons with borders, color and detail to them.
+ Undocumented Secrets: Some things were done, yadda yadda. :P
+ Optimization: Over a 3 day period, over 61,100 bytes of complied code size was cut [over 11.6% of 5.14's total size O__O], and hopefully some slightly improved gameplay speed. You better appriciate this, darn you. :P (edit, a lot of this code size has be readded with most of the new features]
+ Displays & Enemies: A monster given a zvel in Mapster32 that includes "1024" will make that monster place a "BOSS" lifemeter just above the character's stats. Although this is intended specfically for major bosses, any enemy can be given this, and up to THREE bosses can have these lifemeters on screen at once.


=SINCE 5.13=

+ Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where using a Super Atom on a dead character could resurrect them when it wasn't supposed to. Thanks to TheSeriousCacodemon from bring this up in his NR Talkthrough [see above under "Credits"].
+ Voices: Cybanis has new sounds for wall grunts, landing sounds, mirror-use sounds, and such.
+ Voices: Lisa now has a bunch of new interaction sounds including Riot-Tank driving one-liners, wall grunts, pain sounds and such.
+ Visuals: The VR Visor and Mercury Mini Computer now use better and improved pixel-art graphics that look more accurate to the items instead of the older sprites from SMDoom. These sprites were made by Christina Richter @ http://blaubeermars.deviantart.com
+ Characters: Characters' ability to "Cheat Death" [aka survive an otherwise fatal hit with 1 HP left] will increase slighly for every level they get.
+ Characters: Characters' falling resistances will increase slightly over the course of their level ups.
+ Characters: Characters can now gain slightly better [natural] HP regeneration speed as they level up. Other characters [Duke, Lo Wang, Ted, Lisa, Minako] also have naturally faster regeneration rates now [instead of JUST Minako or Ami when in water].
+ Tally System: The number of saved civilians for the current level now shows in the in-game menus.
+ Vehicles: Empty Riot Tanks [the drivable kind] can sometimes [on rare occasions] appear in the same spot as a weapon in non-NR maps. This does not REPLACE the weapon like most items that "turn into" another, though.


=SINCE 5.12=

+ VR Visor: The VR Visor can now show the various Elemental Effects on enemies, including Resistance, Weakness, Immunity, and Absorbancy.
+ Main Menu/Shop Menu/Game Over Screen: Menu Transitions for Entering and Exiting Menus now [as well as for the Game Over Screen]
+ Hitscanning: Now all monsters and NPCs' names will display for a target when your crosshair is on them instead of just for items and pickups.
+ Damage Displays: The Angle Indicator will now appear when you get hit by Melee attacks/Steam/Fire/Floorflames, etc
+ Damage Displays: If you get hit by one of your own attacks/explosion-radii, you will see a graphic of your current character instead of no visual indicator in front of your portrait.
+ Damage Displays: Now when you attack an enemy, you will see your portrait [as well as your vehicle's portrait if your attack was from a vehicle] vaugely behind the picture of the victim monster/NPC.
+ Damage Displays: Now when you are attacked, you will see either your current character's portrait or your current vehicle's portrait vaugely behind the picture of the attacking enemy. This is to make sure you know whether you or the vehicle you're driving in is taking the damage, because some things can still hurt the character driving in a vehicle, such as 'usable' hazards.
+ Tally System: You will now be able to see the total amount of kills/monsters, secrets, and items collected for the entire game playthrough[as opposed to just the current level] while you are in the paused game screen.
+ Tally System: When your "Kills", "Secrets", or "Memorbilia" are perfect for the level, they will flash many colors, and if there are none of a type of tally, that tally does not appear at all in the In-Game Menus for that level.
+ Tally System: "Memorbilia" is now a tally in the In-Game menus for the current level. Memorbilia is the amount of RANK-giving items in the current level, including movie posters, figurines, magazines, etc.
+ New Item: "Unknown Medicene" gives an "emulated" level up to one character at the cost of half their HP and Poisoning them at the same time.
+ New Skill: Maken can now use the skill "Triad Booster", which gives 15 seconds of the "Triad Booster" status to any character. Triad Booster makes a character's attack damage and defense against attacks improved by 20% each.
+ New Skill: Jack can now use the skill "Damage Shell", which gives 15 seconds of the "Shell" status to any character. Shell reduces damage by most things by around 1/3.
+ Speed System Rehaul. Speed now works more relative to the actual number of the character's stat instead of by the old Duke Nukem 3D method.


=SINCE 5.11=

+ Higa, ESSence, Cybanis and Nethra all have topographic sprite views for the overhead_map mode now.
+ Vehicles: Riot Tanks [Green, Blue and Red] can be found empty and drivable. They also have their own weapons and stats, and take most if not all damage that is directed at the character driving them. However ESSence and Cybanis cannot drive Riot Tanks due to them being too large[in storyline terms] to fit into them.
+ Toggles Menu: A New Toggle for Pickups/Buying items for vehicles. There are four options, one for just giving items to the character driving the vehicle, another for just giving items to the vehicle, a third for giving to both character and vehicle, but character first, and then finally a fourth that inverses the priority to vehicle, then character.
+ Inventory/Equip Menu: Items now have specialized plates behind them as well, and the icon and amount displays properly sized and centered based on thus.
+ Graphical Work: All of Lo Wang's sprites are imported properly to TILES033.ART
+ Graphical Work: BOSS1/BOSS2 now have jumping and crouching frames[used for ESSence and Cybanis mostly]
+ Character Menu: Characters now have specialized plates behind their stats. The "Vehicle in Use" also has it's own type of plate behind it's stats.
+ Character/Item/Skill: The 16th character slot is now the holder of your current vehicle's stats when driving one, and can also be used to distribute benficial items and character skills to the vehicle while in use.
+ New Features: Vehicles are on their way to NR! The first will be a drivable version of the Pigcop's Riot Tank, with normal and alt-fire modes of attack, and similar slow manuverability.
+ System Change: The quote display at the top of the screen is revised to use a smaller font[75% original size] to show longer quotes better and for other various reasons. Additionally, the quotes will zoom in and zoom out of existance.


=SINCE 5.10=

+ Miscellaneous: Keypad Buttons briefly darken when pressed.
+ Environmental Changes: Using a Keypad will now show a display of the keypad below the entry bar. The keys also make beeps when pressed and there are new success/fail sounds for the default keypads.
+ Miscellaneous: ATM Buttons briefly darken when pressed.
+ Environmental Changes: ATMs, Snack Machinea and Cola Machines now make noises of their own when used[ATM Beeps/Money Dispensing, and Cola/Snack Dispensing sounds].
+ Character-Specfic Revision: ESSence can fly up faster with the Jetpack when his specialized ESS-Armor is removed. To remove/add his armor[as a reminder], highlight him in the character menu and use the proper keys[INSERT/DELETE are the defaults] to swap his form. The form change can also be used on Bubsy, Ami, Christina/Nethra & Minako as well.
+ Gameplay Revision: ACCESSSWITCH3/ACCESSSWITCH4 no longer operated on a limit of 128 lotags for full synch[formerly, you had to use lotaga 10001 to 10128 for it to work fully]. Now an array-based system is used that cuts down on code size and works just as well if not better, allowing ANY lotag to work with full synch. XD
+ Inventory Feature: The rest of the armor items [all the color-coded armor(Actor: COLORSHIELD)] can now be stored in the inventory. The items now appear on the second page of the items submenu.
+ Inventory Feature: Most items can now be "dropped" out of your inventory onto the ground. After laying there for 1.5 seconds[without the menus up], the item can be grabbed again by you, enemies or allies. The idea of being able to drop items is for the player to supply items to bot allies they might have in future versions of the game, or to mess around and leave items for monsters to grab[for the sake of fun or giving yourself a challenge]
+ Shop Features: When looking at health and armor items in the menu, you'll see your HP/AP % above the number of stored Health/Armor items.
+ Shop Features: Items in the Buy Menu will be red when you lack the funds to buy them.
+ Shop Features: Several more items can now be sold at shops for money.
+ Miscellaneous: New/Revised Character Portraits for all 15 characters.
+ Inventory Features: 19 more items can be grabbed and stored for later use in the inventory: Small Medikits, Medium Medikits, Large Medikits, Extra-Large Medikits, Med Packs, Surgery Kits, Atomic Healths, Super Atoms, Body Armor [fresh and used versions], Super Armor [fresh and used versions], Portable Medikits, Scuba Gear, Protective Boots, Holoforms, Jetpacks, Vitamin X bottles & pairs of Nightvision Goggles.
+ Item Removals: Stimpacks and Box Medikits have been removed due to redundancy issues.
+ Bugfix: Items spawned via RESPAWN sprites carry over pickup flags, allowing you to spawn specialized items with the RESPAWNs.
+ Bugfix: Nightvision amounts display properly in shops again.
+ Shops: When viewing ammo items and energy cell items, you can see the max ammo your character-in-use can hold of that item. Same with energy cells[even though only Lisa can utilize those].
+ Monster Change: Giving the LIZTROOP a zvel/ACTORFLAGS of at least 4096 will make them wake up in their 'suicide bomber' mode from the get go.


=SINCE 5.09=

+ Pause-Related Change: Pausing the Game will now dim the screen and remove most displays[stats, menus, shop-menu, ATM-screen, etc], but will also show one of five[more in later versions] specialized 'pause quotes' depending on the current character, which change every so often the longer the game is left paused.
+ New Feature: In-game real-time clocks.
+ Gameplay Change: Going into "Weapon Holstered" mode now also activates "Defense Mode", which acts as an RPG-type "Defend" command, reducing all damage by enemy attacks[but not hazards and falls, etc] by 1/2.
+ Monster Change: LIZTROOPs now possess a limited amount of Jetpack energy which can be exhausted. In response, they will now attempt to grab any nearby Jetpacks they find if needed. They will also be unable to fly after you if they have no energy left in their jetpacks.
+ Monster Change: LIZTROOPs of any non-22 palette can now activate a suicidal depth charge in their vests when low on HP and then explode at close range as suicide bombers. Ravager Captains that utilize suicide bombings are 3-4 times stronger and release a larger explosion on death as well[due to their high-use of explosives in general]. Additionally, if their bombs are armed for 15 seconds or more, they will explode automatically. However on the upside, you'll hear a beep from them every 1.5 seconds when their bombs are armed.
+ Change: PODFEM1 actors now leave their pod behind when rescued.
+ Change: FEM2 actors now leave their pole behind when rescued.
+ New Damagefloor: HYPERMAGMA. Is intended as an editor-only hazard which will not likely appear in storyline levels.
+ Atomspheric Change: WATERSPLASH2s are more realistic depending on the palette of the water sector and/or the floor/ceiling texture of water sectors[i.e. WATERSPLASH2s spawned in NEWFLOORPLASMA are light-red instead of the usual blue].
+ New Feature: The Freezethrower can be used to temporarily freeze NEWFLOORPLASMA, HOTLAVA, MEGALAVA, ULTRALAVA and HYPERMAGMA damagefloors.
+ New Feature: Single Pipebombs and Mortars will now automatically explode at random if they land in firey hazards [NEWFLOORPLASMA, HOTLAVA, MEGALAVA, ULTRALAVA, HYPERMAGMA]
+ New Feature: Monsters and Non-Player actors now receive fall-damage.
+ New Actors: ANIMEGIRL1, ANIMEGIRL2, ANIMEGIRL3 & ANIMEGIRL4 NPC actors added.
+ Change: Rank points now determine a special level that is shown with letters [D, C, B, A, S, etc] at various levels of Rank Points. The rank points still don't have much other use yet, but I am trying to think of something... maybe cheaper shops or stuff or better items in some shops depending on Rank. [Actually, Rank WILL have a minor effect on the game's ending, but nothing significant as of yet.]
+ Bugfix: Hopefully I've fixed the dang Rank overflow bug once and for all concerning secret areas. >___>
+ New Feature: You can now identify items by pointing your crosshair at them, similar to some more recent FPS games. There is also an option in the Toggles menu to turn this feature on or off in case you don't like it. :P
+ Pickup Flag Addition: Adding 16384 to the ACTORFLAGS/zvel of money actors will make them undetectable on the money radar. Good for putting money in hidden areas or keeping the higher denomination bills from just appearing too easily to the player. However in general, the "16384" is going to be a "special" flag, which will differ in effect for each type of pickup.


=SINCE 5.08=

+ Bugfix: Octabrains without pal 14 were not expanding and exploding correctly via the expander due to an oversight I made while implementing the speed change for the Octanine in 5.08.
+ Shops: Improvements were made allowing you to see how much you have of any items you're buying, instead of just when you're selling.
+ Shops: All the Equippable Items can now be bought in the main shop.
+ Equippable Items: Experience Badge, Rank Badge and Money Badge created. All of these items double their respective property for the player/character when worn. Multiple of the same badge will add to the multiplier.
+ Equipment System: Full Equip Menu support available now! :D As a note, equipment works this way: You can have up to four slots, or as few as just one, depending on the difficulty level. Skills 0 to 9 allow for all four slots, Skills 1 to 9 allow three slots, Skills 4 to 9 allow only two slots, and Skills 7 to 9 will give you only a single slot.
+ Equipment System: All effects for the Sun Ring, Aqua Ring, Plasma Ring and Spirit Ring are available [Sun = Fire -25%, Explosives -22.5%; Aqua = Water -25%, Ice -22.5%; Plasma = Electric -25%, Energy -22.5%; Spirit = All Mystic Damage -33%]
+ Equipment System: All effects for the "Mirror Shield" are available. [Damage cut in half, rest deflected to attacker]
+ Support System: All aspects of the support system with the except of the conversations themselves and a means to access them are implemented, including stat bonuses and other effects support levels have on gameplay.
+ Equipment System: All effects for the "Charm Ankh" are available. [HP Regen Rate, and Artifact Regen Rates]
+ Support System: All formulas concerning damagefloors are finished on the Support System.
+ Support System: All formulas concerning damage to monsters are finished on the Support System.
+ Oversight Fix: COP1 NPC Actor can now be damaged/killed by reactor, lightning, fire and steam damage as they should've been since the beginning.
+ Menu Change: Equipment SubMenu is added.
+ Menu Change: Support SubMenu is added. However the direct implementations of the ranks and the conversations are not yet finished. This is only the menu so far.
+ Menu Change: WorldTile SubMenu is added that will display all of the 128 WorldTiles that will appear in NR later on as you find them.


=SINCE 5.07=

+ In-Game Menu Change: Toggle Menu is changed. Moving the cursor will now make the normal Kick sound that the main Duke3D menu uses, toggling an option will make the 'thwack!' sound Duke3D normally uses in it's menu. The font colors are also changed to more match the color scheme of the main Duke3D menu. And finally, when you have a toggle selected, you now see a short description of it's function, which will differ depending on if the toggle is turned on or off.
+ Graphic Changes: Title Screen background is altered, and the "ATOMIC" logos are now replaced by a title for the mod. The title's style might change in later versions.
+ New Cosmetic Feature: FIREVASE and FIREBARREL now have 'fireless' sprites, both for decor, and for when they are placed underwater[which puts out the fire part].
+ New Feature: Steam and Fire Actors added to maps in Mapster32 can given an attack stat of their own to make them actually threatening to the player. This can be done by changing the "Extra" of the actors in question[STEAM, CEILINGSTEAM, FIRE, FIRE2, BURNING, BURNING2, FIREBARREL, FIREVASE]
+ Bugfix: Fixed a bug where steam and fire actors broke their code and never did damage to the player regardless of their defense.
+ Bugfix: The "Negative RANK awards for a Secret Area" bug is fixed for real this time. >_>
+ Enemy Balance Change: Octanines[OCTABRAIN Pal 14] now move 75% faster than normal Octabrains.
+ Detail-Based Change: Armor items now have different sprites depending on which character is in play. ESSence and Cybanis have their own varients, and female characters also have their own. All other characters have the usual varient of the armor item.
+ Ememy Balance Change: Bloodtooth Sharks have ~+10% more Base HP [3535 to 3885]
+ Ememy Balance Change: Ravager Captains have ~+13% more Base HP [70 to 80]
+ Ememy Balance Change: Upgraded Enforcers[Laser/Bio-Warrior] have ~+15% more Base HP [Laser: 150 to 165, Bio-Warrior: 200 to 230]
+ Ememy Balance Change: Upgraded Pigcops[Captain/Sargeant] have ~+30% more Base HP [Captain: 150 to 180, Sargeant: 200 to 260]
+ Enemy Balance Change(s): A number of monsters have altered/fixed/changed resistances, weaknesses and such.
+ Player/Character Balance Change(s): Some characters' have altered stat grow curves from the previous versions.
+ Player/Character Balance Change: Characters gain a little more air-time for swimming per level up from previous versions.
+ Improvement: Updated code for 9/1/2008 EDuke32 Snapshot.


=SINCE 5.06=

+ Performance Change: AIRBUBBLES will not spawn from bubble generators when framerate is below 25 to keep large groups of them from bogging down the game to a halt. :P
+ Major Bugfix: A long running and elusive bug where Bubsy being the last character to die in your group would for some reason not allow you to press space/open at the Game Over screen to go back to the main menu was finally fixed.
+ Actor Update(s): TRASHBAG1-4 and TRASHCAN1-2 now sometimes drop a little coin money when destroyed[because SOME people throw away their pennies >_>;]
+ Art Change: A few new portraits in TILES031.ART for future NPCs and villains.
+ Map Change: !NR.map has a few additions/changes that include use of item-pickup flags, and showing off other more little known effects [reactors/lightning hurting monsters, etc]
+ Improvement: Updated code for 8/24/2008 EDuke32 Snapshot.


=SINCE 5.05=

+ Fix: A character's death no longer causes Bubsy's extra-lives to decrement by 1 if he is selected next.
+ Oversight Fix: Christina/Nethra's "Heal Life" abilities can no longer be used to revive another character from death.
+ AI Change: LIZTROOPs no longer cloak themselves or flee when Invulnerable and will be a little more aggressive when using such.
+ Fix: Smaller/Larger versions of other monsters have more accurate sized clipping spheres to accomedate their size.
+ Fix: Fixed up BOSS1-4 clipping spheres to attempt to allow projectiles to hit them better[they were set too low due to lack of proper knowledge in the past].
+ Oversight Fix: An oversight was fixed where NPCs dying by either a player's attacks or a monster's attacks would still make the current character spout a monster-kill one-liner.
+ Voices: Lisa and Maken now have lines for picking up the Powerup-Artifacts.
+ Voices: Cybanis now has lines for picking up the Powerup-Artifacts.
+ Voices: Bubsy now has PROPER voice lines for picking up the Powerup-Artifacts.
+ Voices: Jack and ESSence's one-liners have been optimized to much smaller sizes.
+ Voices: Lisa and Maken's one-liners have been optimized to somewhat smaller sizes.
+ Voices: Bubsy now has all 18 of his one-liners voiced.


=SINCE 5.04=

+ Bugfix: PIGCOP, COMMANDER and NEWBEAST no longer can be multi-killed by Expander[GROWSPARK] shots. There was originally a bug where their cstats weren't being set properly and this caused them to be able to be 'killed' over and over with the expander to get extra EXP/RANK/Drops.
+ For lesser machines[>.>] there's the option to set the var ATTACHEDOBJECTS? on[1+] or off[0] to clear up some sprite usage from the attached objects, but it will make the game feel less complete.
+ You can now toggle whether the Bio-Shield will regenerate it's energy to full cells, just it's free-cell, or not at all by changing the var "BIOSHIELDRECHARGABLE?" to 2, 1, or 0 in SPECIAL.CON
+ Lisa's Bio-Shield now possesses a "Free-Cell" of damage-absorbsion. This free-cell will automatically regenerate itself if the shield is completely depleted.
+ The Bio-Shield's damage absorbsion formula is redone to be more effective.
+ Hacker Vision will now tell you if there is security damage on a KEYPAD or HANDSCANNER and what type it is. It will not tell you the damage level itself however.
+ Lisa now does 75% bonus damage with all energy-based weapons/projectiles.
+ BLOODPOOLs/NEWBLOODPOOLs no longer spawn underwater or in water.
+ Lisa's Bio-Shield can now block off damage deflected by invulnerable monsters.
+ All character one-liners are now set up that the miniquote texts for each one liner will only show up if a character is not talking. This means you no longer see multiple one-liner quotes while a character is talking.
+ An oversight in the player's level-up code was causing their Critical Hit % to rise twice as much per level then it should've been. This was already coded fine for the individual characters' level-up codes though.
+ You no longer get bonus Crit points for killing monsters or surviving mortal hits to keep some balance.
+ Maken has voices for all of her One-Liners
+ Lisa has voices for all of her One-Liners
+ Cybanis has voices for all of his One-Liners
+ Christina has 15 out of 18 voices for her One-Liners
+ Nethra has 2 out of 18 voices for her One-Liners
+ ESSence has voices for all of his One-Liners
+ Jack has voices for all of his One-Liners
+ Lisa's "Lady Luck" skill now works different at Level 100 then in past versions. Instead of even more money actors spawning, the types of money spawned will be of higher dollar denominations then when she's not Level 100. This was done to scale back on the sheer amount of money actors spawned from groups of slain enemies which could heavily bog down the game.
+ Deathgate/Deathstroke Missiles will remain in 5.05 for now due to the lack of coded features in the upcoming version so far.
+ Redone Bloodpools now spawn at the proper height on sloped sectors.
+ All attached-objects on actors have been fixed up to keep track of their owner's current sector as to not disappear randomly on levels with lots of sectors stacked on top of each other, like Tier Drops[E3L10].
+ Characters now have a 'height' variable which plays into their in-story heights and also their mantling lengths.
+ Minor display bug fixed for the status screen.
+ A bug was fixed where the Shark's Quad Damage, Invulnerability and Vampire timers went down at double the proper speed.


=SINCE 5.03=

+ Weapon Alterations: I have made a pair of attacks called the "Deathgate Missile" and the "Deathstroke Missile". For 5.04 only, there will be direct access to their use with the RPG instead of the RPG-Shotgun. When using the RPG, pressing "5" will toggle between the type of Missile you wish to shoot. The missiles can be shot as large, individual missiles with extremely high damage, or with the Alt-Fire[Quick-Kick] key, they can be split into smaller missiles in a shotgun-type spread to hit multiple enemies while they are in mid-flight.
+ 3 new fortunes for the Fortune Cookie.
+ New Powerup/Artifact: Vampire Artifact. The holder will drain 50% of all HP and AP damage done to their opponent to heal their own up to 150% of each. In commerical releases this value will be downgraded to 25% absorbsion up to 125%.
+ Nethra now has SIX support skills: "Lesser Resurrection", "Heal Life [Lesser]", "Cure Ailment [Moderate]", "Heal Life [Greater]", "Greater Resurrection", and "Cure Ailment [Greatest]". Lesser Resurrection revives one person with 40% HP. Greater Resurrection revives one person with 80% HP. Heal Life [Lesser] restores 33% HP to one person, up to 133%. Heal Life [Greater] restores 66% HP to one person, up to 166%. Cure Ailment [Moderate] cures "Poison", "Dimness" and "Confusion". Cure Ailment [Greater] cures "Poison", "Dimness", "Confusion" and "Slow".
+ Ami now has a second skill: "Mercury Quickening", which gives 15 seconds of "Haste" to one person
+ Ted now has 3 Support Skills: "Fortify [Lesser]", "Fortify [Moderate]" and "Fortify [Greater]", all of which increase Armor Absorbsion % of one person by a set amount based on the current % and the skill's level.
+ Skill usage on party members supported. Some new skills will be present in the newest release.


=SINCE 5.02=

+ Various Commerical-Special Enhancements made. These kinds of updates relate to a difference between "Public Beta" and "Official Release". Things are set up to be a lot different when "Official Release" mode is set.
+ Octabrains now have weaknesses to heat and explosive type attacks.
+ Signficantly improved the Super Drone[actor DRONE, Pal 25]'s close-range ramming attack. First off it will now knock the player a distance away from the Drone upon hit, depending on the character, and it also has improved sound effects and stops the Drone briefly upon a successful ram to allow slower players a brief chance to escape before it continues attacking.
+ An important bugfix was made where most melee-inflicted damage from enemies kept adding onto later damage to the player for non-melee attacks.
+ If the gamevar "CAMERAMODE?" is set to 1, your current character will determine the height of the viewing camera to simulate the differences in each character's canonical height. It is set to 0 however by default since it is incomplete and for testing only right now.
+ Health and Armor Lifebars will flash when their respective owners are damaged.
* Changed the "hum" sound for the Bio-Cell Energy Shield to a set of five that play at different volumes depending on the damage strength.
* Improved the money calculation code for factoring in CENTS overflows so they don't appear anymore. Done for both HUD and for Pickup Displays.
+ Steroids now reduce Damagefloor/sector damage by the factor as they do normal damage from attacks.
+ All jury-rigged/booby-trapped pickups can be detected by having Ami turn her VR Visor on. Said objects will glow a night-vision green. Normal Night-Vision does NOT work to find booby-trapped items so be warned.
+ Money Radar will now be able to detect jury-rigged money objects by changing the pointer-arrow to a RED color instead of GREEN. Additionally, fully-booby trapped money will not register on the radar at all.
+ Steroids now last 50% longer when used for a normal pickup.
+ "Pickup Flags" system implemented... See section above for all details.


=SINCE 5.01=

+ Many states from GAME.CON were moved over to STATES.CON for technical reasons.
+ -20% Compile Size from 5.01
+ Fixed a bug where switching from a Non-Invulnerable character in mid-fall to an Invulnerable character caused the Invulnerable character to take fall-damage upon hitting the ground.
+ Two Non-Player Character ATM accounts can now be accessed through the ATM machines.
+ Mantle/Grappling Time no longer decrements while you are invulnerable via the Icon of the Defender.
+ Improved Hit-Detection of most of the customized switches in NR.
+ Stat-up displays now include displays for Speed, Air-Time, Mantle-Time and Airjumps from both leveling up and grabing bonus items.
+ Fixed the stat-up displays for the selecter-character's level-up process and bonus-item grabbing. They are also smaller and moved towards the top left instead of overlapping the lower HUD.
+ "Large" and "Extra-Large" versions of all stat-bonus items now supported. Palette 3 makes the bonus "Large"(4x the usual benefits), and Palette 9 makes the bonus "Extra-Large"(9x the usual benefits). Monsters will NOT drop anything but normal sized stat bonuses.
+ Fixed a bug with buying SuperAtoms from DEALERs that made them not give you the proper amount of HP if your max HP was higher than your max AP.
+ New ambient music sounds THRILLER_MUSIC and PIG_MASK_RADIO added.
+ Protozoid Slimers now die automatically if they attach to you while you're invulnerable via the Icon of the Defender or God Mode.
+ A Protozoid Slimer will now die automatically if they manage to successfully kill the character they're currently latched onto.
+ Compact-Handscanners[COMPACTHANDSCANNER/COMPACTHANDSCANNER2] have been made for better use of "embedded" scanners inside of walls.
+ You can now longer use/activate Keypads, Handscanners or customized Keycard-Readers if they are behind active forcefields.
+ Trash Bags[TRASHBAG1-TRASHBAG4] and other Trash Can[TRASHCAN1-TRASHCAN3] actors are now destructible and break into pieces of shrapnel and papers on getting hit.
* Money Radar feature: Money Radar will seek the closest money-type actors with the highest denominations and point in the horizontal direction of the detected money-object. If the object is in the player's sight, the arrow will be light green, else if it cannot be seen by the player's view, it will be a darker green color. Money in denominations from $500 and up will also glow, and extremely high denominations will glow faster.
+ Steam[STEAM/CEILINGSTEAM] and Fire-actors[FIRE,FIRE2,BURNING,BURNING2] now damage monsters and other NPCs who get too close to them.
+ Monsters/NPCs suffer extra damage on damaging hazards when shrunken.
+ Players suffer extra damage on damaging hazards when shrunken.
+ Damage done by Protozoid Slimers now pops up in the player's damage-display area.
+ Lisa's Bio-Shield now protects her from Protozoid Slimer bite-damage when turned on, however does not destroy the Slimers. They must still be killed in the normal way to get them off.
+ Lisa's Bio-Shield will now give her random protection[33.4%-66.6%] from falling-damage when turned on. The exact amount is usually closer to 50%, but is always random.


=SINCE 5.00=

+ "STAYPUT" actors no longer try to go to grab items that are outside of their home-sector to reduce AI hangs.
+ Sentry Drones and Super Drones now take additional damage from electrical attacks such as ZAPPER1, ZAPPER2 & ZAPPER3. They will also take additional damage from NEWHURTRAIL if they are close enough to the floor.
+ Maken now has a skill/ability called "Triad Blitzkrieg" which is a self-only status 'buff', allowing all of her attacks to ignore 75% of her enemies/targets' defense stat.
+ Mindblasts[COOLEXPLOSION1] that hit the player will now only try to inflict 'confusion' on the character if the amount of HIT POINT damage dealt to them exceeds a random level between 5% to 10%. This means you can no longer worry about being confused if you have a full-armor item on.
+ Spit Loogies that hit the player will now only try to inflict 'poison' on the character if the amount of HIT POINT damage dealt to them exceeds a random level between 5% to 10%. This means you can no longer worry about being poisoned if you have a full-armor item on.
+ Shrinker Troopers, Ravager Captains will teleport more often than before.
+ Assault Captains now shoot twin lasers or a double pistol shot as their attack.
+ Energy Reactors will now damage monsters that get close to them as well.
+ Energy Reactors also show damage in the player-damage display area.
+ Energy Reactors[REACTOR/REACTOR2] will now inflict proper damage to the player[they had been overlooked after the big stat-conversion project back in 4.8x].
+ Lightning Bolts will now damage monsters that get close to them as well.
+ Lightning Bolts also show damage in the player-damage display area.
+ Lightning Bolts[NATURALLIGHTNING] will now inflict proper damage to the player[they had been overlooked after the big stat-conversion project back in 4.8x].


(All Features prior to 5.x are too far back to fully remember, so yeah...)

==BEFORE 4.8x==

+ Stat Conversions: Versions prior to 4.8x had Health/HP and Armor/AP linked to the normal game's structs for the player [.extra and .shield_amount]. However these structs have a limit of "32767", and it heavily limited the growth of both characters and enemies, so a "rerouting" of these stats had been required, now using gamevars instead of said structs to record HP and AP, allowing both to reach a maximum of "524288" [or "1048576" with Atomic Health/Super Armor/Super Atoms]. Attack and Defense were also extended to have these increased limits as well.
