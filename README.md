Naferia's Reign: Invasion of the Dark Mistress

 - Installing 1. - Make a new folder with a fresh copy of Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition. There doesn't need to be anything else in it for now.

 - Installing 2. - Unzip the contents of the NR-IotDM-master.zip into the folder you made above. Don't put the files in their own directory, since a proper version of EDuke32.exe is packaged with this.

 - Running 1. - Hit eduke32.exe and the game should load up.
 - Optional. - Make a command line or bat file and put in "start eduke32.exe -map warp exit". This will load you up in warp.map where you can select all the difficulty levels or select a specfic episode to start from or even a special LEVEL. And also test some stuff out. :P
